# Input Guide

>All of the required information can be found in the project manual; this is just a short summary of that.


## Units:
* mass - in kg
* gravitationalConstant - in m/s
* maximumSpeed - m/s
* targetRadius - m

The rest should be obvious. It would be nice to add input validation, to make sure the user input is within
the manual's restrictions; however, it's not necessary.
